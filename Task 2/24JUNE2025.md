## 3. Advanced Sender Authentication Analysis {#sender-analysis}

### 3.1 Email Address Forensics

#### Display Name vs. Actual Address Analysis
```
Example Analysis:
Display Name: "PayPal Security Team"
Actual Address: security-update@paypaI-verification.com
                                    ^ Note: Capital 'i' instead of 'l'

Red Flags Identified:
- Character substitution attack (paypaI vs paypal)
- Unverified domain (paypaI-verification.com)
- Display name spoofing
```

#### Domain Analysis Techniques
1. **WHOIS Investigation**
   ```bash
   whois suspicious-domain.com
   # Check registration date, registrar, contact info
   # Recent registrations (<30 days) are suspicious
   ```

2. **DNS Analysis**
   ```bash
   dig suspicious-domain.com
   nslookup suspicious-domain.com
   # Verify MX records, A records, geographic location
   ```

3. **Typosquatting Detection**
   - Levenshtein distance analysis
   - Homograph attack identification
   - Subdomain abuse patterns

### 3.2 Advanced Spoofing Techniques

#### Domain Spoofing Variations
- **Homograph Attacks**: Using Unicode characters (аmazon.com using Cyrillic 'а')
- **Subdomain Spoofing**: legitimate-site.attacker-domain.com
- **TLD Manipulation**: paypal.support instead of paypal.com
- **Hyphenation**: pay-pal.com or paypal-security.com

#### Display Name Manipulation
```
Technique: Display Name Spoofing
Legitimate: "PayPal" <noreply@paypal.com>
Malicious:  "PayPal" <phishing@malicious-domain.com>

Detection Method:
1. Compare display name with actual domain
2. Verify if domain matches organization
3. Check for authorized sending domains
```

Analysis Points:
- Pass/Fail/SoftFail/Neutral status
- IP address verification
- Domain alignment check
- Policy mechanism examination
```

- Algorithm (a=rsa-sha256)
- Canonicalization (c=relaxed/relaxed)
- Domain (d=legitimate.com)
- Selector (s=default)
- Signature validation status
```

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication) Evaluation**
```
Authentication-Results: mx.google.com;
       dmarc=pass (p=QUARANTINE sp=QUARANTINE dis=NONE) header.from=legitimate.com

Policy Analysis:
- p=NONE/QUARANTINE/REJECT (domain policy)
- sp=NONE/QUARANTINE/REJECT (subdomain policy)
- dis=NONE/QUARANTINE/REJECT (disposition)
- Alignment mode (r=relaxed/strict)
```

### 4.2 Routing and Infrastructure Analysis

        by mx.recipient.com with ESMTP id ABC123
        for <victim@recipient.com>; Mon, 1 Jan 2024 12:00:00 +0000

Analysis Framework:
1. Server hostnames and IP addresses
2. Geographic routing anomalies
3. Timestamp analysis for delays
4. Protocol and encryption usage
5. Relay server legitimacy
```

#### X-Originating-IP Analysis
```bash
# IP Geolocation Analysis
whois 192.168.1.100

    error_count = len(errors)
    density = (error_count / word_count) * 100
    
    return {
        'total_words': word_count,
        'total_errors': error_count,
        'error_density': density,
        'quality_score': max(0, 100 - (density * 10))
    }
```
